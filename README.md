# House-valuation-model
A Challenge Project in a Boot-Camp to create a ML Model to predict the prices of houses in Boston Massachusetts from multiple parameters Using Multivariable Regression.


Building a Regression Model that can Provide a Home Price Estimate based on home's characteristics like:

* The number of rooms
* The distance to employment centres
* How rich or poor the area is
* How many students there are per teacher in local schools etc

• Accuracy on Training data : 79%<br>
• Accuracy on Testing data : 74%
